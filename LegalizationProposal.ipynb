    "Colorado became the first U.S. State to legalize the cultivation and sale of Marijuana, effective as of January 1st, 2014. Many detractors argued that 'legal' dispensaries would lead to an increase in crime, including violent crime and therefore many cities and counties within Colorado banned dispensaries within their given municipal boundaries. What we are looking to determine is whether Marijuana sales within a municipality lead to an increase in crime that wouldn't be expected otherwise. To do this we need a population that we can divide into 2 groups, designed to be as randomn as possible."

Cities that have not allowed dispensaries will be the control group, and the null hypothesis is that the legal sale of Marijuana DOES lead to an increase in the crime rate. "

    "Our research method will be performing A/B testing where we can compare the crime rate betveen 2 identical groups, or realisitically two groups that are as identical as possible from where this experiment could be feasibily conducted. The ideal situation would be two cities that are as alike as possible, demographics, geographically, politically, and most importantly crime rate. Being within the same state is recommended as to ensure all other laws are the same for both groups, for example access to firearms. If possible the cities should not be close enough distance to allow populations to easily travel back in forth without air travel, as air travel between 2 cities does not allow easy or legal transport of significant amounts of Marijuana. The city that does not allow Marijuana sales will be the control group, which will be chosen at random between the 2."
